  # Stock-Price-Prediction
  
  Stock Price Prediction was a final year project, aim was to predict the future values of a listed stock for a short term. It is a web application where user need   to enter the ticker symbol for a listed stock, and it will predict the future values in the form of graph with dates and values. The predicted graph show the       values like the start date will be the date when the stock listed in the respective exchanges and then the future values.
  
  <br>
  
  Graph also has one feature which is useful when there is a lot of values to represent, like the old stocks, where that feature allow the user to hover to any       specific point in the graph to check what is the values? then after hovering to that point graph shows a dialog box with stock name and its value at that point.

      7. ##IMPORTANT KEY POINTS##
      8. There is new thing I found is that yahoo finance api randomly stop responding, because I faced that too then I look over StackOverflow where it states that it happens because yahoo limit the person accessibility.
      9. For that I use manually datasets and I suggest you to find other api or use manuall datasets.
      10. I am uploading that file with name model_1.py where code is work when you have same manual dataset downloaded in your system i.e., csv files.
      11. A file api.py is used when API was working fine, but when it stop workin, I update the app.py file.
